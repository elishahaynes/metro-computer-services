Metro Computer Services Website

Welcome to my final project for the Front End Web Development course at Code Louisville! This is a website that will eventually be a fully functioning site for the local IT company my Partner owns. The final goal of this website is to convey the services that he provides, a way to contact him, and a place to house his blog content. 

Below are the 3 "feature requirements" I have implemented:

1. A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu ("hamburger" menu).               */This was implemented with the main navigation menu/*
2. Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout.       */This was implemented with the Personal & Business Services columns/*
3. Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through.                                  */This was implemented with the testimonials at the bottom of the page/*

All of the "additional requirements" should have been met.
